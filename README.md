# ReservationSystem-HSCapstoneProject
A quick and simple reservation system I made for my high school capstone project
After a long break from coding, I created this system to refresh my skills, focusing on PHP and MySQL for the database.
While I'm not entirely satisfied with the current output, as it's been a while since I last coded, I've noticed improvement as the project has progressed.
This marks my return to coding after a significant hiatus.
